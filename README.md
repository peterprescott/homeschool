# Resources for parents adjusting to home learning

With the COVID-19 business going on and many people finding themselves at home with their kids all day, I wanted to share a list of resources to help keep kids engaged and learning. This is mainly for Kindergarten age kids since that's what mine are. I haven't used most of these and don't endorse any, but listing the ones I've found in case they are helpful for others.

This is also a great resource: https://schoolclosures.org/

Or you could experiment with [unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) :)
